radiate
=======

A Laravel 4 starter with HTML5 Boiler Plate, Twitter Bootstrap, Font Awesome and other cool stuff (SCSS, Boxfile, markdownâ€¦). 

## How it was created

**Laravel 4**: Radiate is a [laravel 4](http://laravel.com) project.

**HTML5 Boiler Plate**: A new view layout was created with blade formatting using all of the code from the H5BP index.html

**CSS/SCSS:** Both CSS and SCSS is included, with min and non min files. Radiate uses best practices from the [github](https://github.com/styleguide/css) and [google](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml) style guides.
