A Laravel 4 starter package with HTML5 Boiler Plate, Twitter Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and a quick little login/register script to get you started. It also includes a Boxfile for those who deploy to pagodabox.

## Tell me more...

Radiate is a [laravel 4](http://laravel.com) project that uses sensible defaults when creating new HTML5/php projects. Here is how it was created:

* The [HTML5 BoilerPlate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) index.html file was turned into a view layout using blade templating; and the js, css, ico, and img files have been added to their corresponding asset directory. (Note: the suggested .htaccess code has also been implemented)

* [Twitter Bootstrap](twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) css and js with support for [font awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome).

* A Boxfile and Boxfile.install is included for those hosting their project on [pagodabox.com](http://pagodabox.com).
